## Overview

Systems programming concerns the development of software and services used by applications and operating systems, e.g., OS functions, defragmenter, web-servers, databases, search tools, backup systems, etc.  This course will provide core skills required to understand, design and implement components of large and small software systems. It will provide an introduction to programming with C and Unix. Lectures and course assignments will be primarily targeted towards skills building in preparation for taking later courses (including CMPSC311). A third of the time will be spent reviewing conceptual material, and the remaining two-thirds will be reserved for working on projects to exercise concepts and improve the students’ skills. The topics of focus will be primarily how to use VMs and terminals, basics of programming, basics of programming in C, debugging code, etc.

The course projects require students to design, develop and debug C programs. The details of the projects will made available in class and through project descriptions on the course website. 

 

## Academic Integrity Course Policy 

Academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner. Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at The Pennsylvania State University, and all members of the University community are expected to act in accordance with this principle. Consistent with this expectation, the University’s Code of Conduct states that all students should act with personal integrity, respect other students’ dignity, rights and property, and help create and maintain an environment in which all can succeed through the fruits of their efforts. 

 

Academic integrity includes a commitment by all members of the University community not to engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation or deception. Such acts of dishonesty violate the fundamental ethical principles of the University community and compromise the worth of work completed by others. 

 

The course projects are to be carried out individually. Students are explicitly not allowed to share information, source code, or even discuss the contents of the projects. Any violation of this policy will be considered cheating and will result in the student receiving an 'F' grade for the project and a full letter grade off the final grade for the course. Students with more than one violation may face stronger penalties per the university policy. 

 

Students are forbidden from copying code, makefiles, or any other material from the Internet (such as publicly available Github repos). Plagiarism will be strictly enforced by the TAs through in-depth reviews of your submissions. Any violation in the letter or spirit of this policy will also be considered cheating, and handled as described above. Note that any publication of the assignments (e.g., via github or other system) is considered a violation of the above policy. 

 

More information on The Department of Computer Science and Engineering’s Academic Integrity Standards, which are applicable to this course, can be found at  https://www.eecs.psu.edu/students/resources/EECS-CSE-Academic-Integrity.aspx 

 

## Virtual Machines/Student Computer 

As part of the course projects, every student will be required to maintain a virtual machine on a personal computer. Students are responsible for administrating and maintaining these virtual machines, and are strongly encouraged to back them up frequently. 

 

It is the student's responsibility to have a functioning and suitably powerful computer to run their virtual machines. Hardware or software failures are the student's responsibility, and can not be used as an excuse for late assignments. The minimum requirements for this computer that is have 100MB free storage, 8MB memory and have a 64-bit processor. Netbooks and tablets are not suitable. 

 

## Course Prerequisites

You must have completed and passed (with a grade of C or better) the prerequisite course CMPSC 221, Object Oriented Programming with Web-Based Applications, which uses Java. You must have completed and passed (C or better) the earlier courses CMPSC 131 and 132. If, instead, you have completed and passed similar courses elsewhere, contact the instructor. Prior experience with Unix or C is not expected, but you should be very familiar with the concepts introduced in CMPSC 131 and 132, and know how to use an integrated development environment, e.g., as Microsoft's Visual Studio. 

 

If possible, you should take CMPEN 331, Computer Organization and Design, at the same time as this course, or within one semester of it. The connection between these courses would be stronger if we could require you to take both at the same time, but that's not possible. In 331, you learn about the basics of memory organization (registers, cache, main memory, virtual memory), instruction execution, exceptions and interrupts, and the translation of procedural programming languages into machine instructions. 

 

We will often give you some code as examples or as a starter kit for an assignment, and use of that material is encouraged. After that point, the programming work should be done on your own. This will be strictly enforced. 

 

## Ethics Statement 

This course considers topics involving systems. As part of this investigation we will cover technologies whose abuse may infringe on the rights of others. As an instructor, I rely on the ethical use of these technologies. Unethical use may include circumvention of existing security or privacy measurements for any purpose, or the dissemination, promotion, or exploitation of vulnerabilities of these services. 

 

Exceptions to these guidelines may occur in the process of reporting vulnerabilities through public and authoritative channels. Any activity outside the letter or spirit of these guidelines will be reported to the proper authorities and may result in dismissal from the class. 

 

Any instance of sharing or plagiarism, copying, cheating on tests, or other disallowed behavior will constitute a breach of ethics and will result in the penalty identified above. Programming assignments must be completed without assistance or cooperation between students. 

 

Students are responsible for reporting any violation of these rules by other students, and failure to constitutes an ethical violation that carries with it similar penalties. 

 

When in doubt, please contact the course professor for advice. Do not undertake any action which could be perceived as technology misuse or cheating anywhere and/or under any circumstances unless you have received explicit permission from Professor McDaniel. 

 

## Disability Accommodation Statement 

Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University’s educational programs. Every Penn State campus has an office for students with disabilities. Student Disability Resources (SDR) website provides contact information for every Penn State campus (http://equity.psu.edu/sdr/disability-coordinator). For further information, please visit Student Disability Resources website (http://equity.psu.edu/sdr/). 

 

In order to receive consideration for reasonable accommodations, you must contact the appropriate disability services office at the campus where you are officially enrolled, participate in an intake interview, and provide documentation: See documentation guidelines (http://equity.psu.edu/sdr/guidelines). If the documentation supports your request for reasonable accommodations, your campus disability services office will provide you with an accommodation letter. Please share this letter with your instructors and discuss the accommodations with them as early as possible. You must follow this process for every semester that you request accommodations. 

 

## Counseling And Psychological Services Statement 

Many students at Penn State face personal challenges or have psychological needs that may interfere with their academic progress, social development, or emotional wellbeing. The university offers a variety of confidential services to help you through difficult times, including individual and group counseling, crisis intervention, consultations, online chats, and mental health screenings. These services are provided by staff who welcome all students and embrace a philosophy respectful of clients’ cultural and religious backgrounds, and sensitive to differences in race, ability, gender identity and sexual orientation.

## Educational Equity/Report Bias Statements

Consistent with University Policy AD29, students who believe they have experienced or observed a hate crime, an act of intolerance, discrimination, or harassment that occurs at Penn State are urged to report these incidents as outlined on the University’s Report Bias webpage (http://equity.psu.edu/reportbias/) 

 

## Mask Wearing Requirements 

We know from existing scientific data that wearing a mask in public can help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the community (Lyu and Wehby, 2020; CDC, 2020; Johns Hopkins Medicine, 2020). Just as you’re expected to wear a shirt and shoes to class every day, everyone -- including the instructor and TAs -- are required to wear a face mask in University buildings, including classrooms and labs. You MUST wear a mask appropriately (i.e., covering both your mouth and nose) in the building if you are attending class in person. Masks have been provided for students, faculty, and staff, and everyone is expected to wear one while on campus or out in the community.   

 

All students, faculty and staff are expected to maintain social distancing (i.e., maintain at least six feet of space between individuals) when possible. Seating patterns and attendance patterns, including assigned seating and closed-off desks/chairs/room sections, have been established to help allow for this distance for your safety. It is also important to follow related guidance communicated by the University and via public postings/signage related to directional traffic flow and maximum occupancy of spaces.   

 

You are not permitted to consume food or drink in classrooms, except for water. If you must drink water, please be especially conscious of maintaining social distancing and minimizing the time your mask is moved aside. Or, better yet, use a straw. Cooperation from EVERYONE will help control the spread of the virus and help us get back to the previous version of campus life as quickly as possible.   

Students with conditions that make it difficult to wear a mask or who choose not to wear a mask may participate in class remotely but may not attend class in person. This is to protect your health and safety as well as the health and safety of your classmates, instructor and the University community. Anyone attending class in person without a mask will be asked to put one on or leave. Refusal to comply with University policies is a violation of the Student Code of Conduct. Students who refuse to wear masks appropriately may face disciplinary action for Code of Conduct violations.
